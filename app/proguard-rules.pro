# Add project specific ProGuard rules here.
# You can control the set of applied configuration files using the
# proguardFiles setting in build.gradle.
#
# For more details, see
#   http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/proguard.html

# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following
# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface
# class:
#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {
#   public *;
#}

# Uncomment this to preserve the line number information for
# debugging stack traces.
#-keepattributes SourceFile,LineNumberTable

# If you keep the line number information, uncomment this to
# hide the original source file name.
#-renamesourcefileattribute SourceFile\

-keep class com.aniruddha81.gaalifinderv2.models.AudioFile


# Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution
-keepattributes Signature

# Keep Gson annotations
# Note: Cannot perform finer selection here to only cover Gson annotations, see also https://stackoverflow.com/q/47515093
-keepattributes RuntimeVisibleAnnotations,AnnotationDefault

### The following rules are needed for R8 in "full mode" which only adheres to `-keepattribtues` if
### the corresponding class or field is matches by a `-keep` rule as well, see
### https://r8.googlesource.com/r8/+/refs/heads/main/compatibility-faq.md#r8-full-mode

# Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature) if present
-if class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken
-keep,allowobfuscation class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken

# Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken
-keep,allowobfuscation class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken

# Keep classes with @JsonAdapter annotation
-keep,allowobfuscation,allowoptimization @com.google.gson.annotations.JsonAdapter class *

# Keep fields with any other Gson annotation
# Also allow obfuscation, assuming that users will additionally use @SerializedName or
# other means to preserve the field names
-keepclassmembers,allowobfuscation class * {
  @com.google.gson.annotations.Expose <fields>;
  @com.google.gson.annotations.JsonAdapter <fields>;
  @com.google.gson.annotations.Since <fields>;
  @com.google.gson.annotations.Until <fields>;
}

# Keep no-args constructor of classes which can be used with @JsonAdapter
# By default their no-args constructor is invoked to create an adapter instance
-keepclassmembers class * extends com.google.gson.TypeAdapter {
  <init>();
}
-keepclassmembers class * implements com.google.gson.TypeAdapterFactory {
  <init>();
}
-keepclassmembers class * implements com.google.gson.JsonSerializer {
  <init>();
}
-keepclassmembers class * implements com.google.gson.JsonDeserializer {
  <init>();
}

# Keep fields annotated with @SerializedName for classes which are referenced.
# If classes with fields annotated with @SerializedName have a no-args
# constructor keep that as well. Based on
# https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/150189783#comment11.
